    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Since the advent of Islam in the 7th century CE, polygyny has been regulated by Sharia. The Quran permits a man to marry up to four wives if he can treat them equally—a regulation designed to curb excessive plural marriage.
    </p>

    <h2>Religious and Cultural Rules</h2>
    <p>
      In Islamic tradition, a man’s ability to maintain justice among multiple wives is emphasized. While the practice was common among wealthy and powerful men historically, modern Islamic societies exhibit varying attitudes, with polygyny being less frequent in urban centers.
    </p>

    <h2>Sociopolitical Structure</h2>
    <p>
      Polygynous households in Islamic societies were often organized around separate living quarters for each wife. This arrangement not only underscored the patriarchal system but also facilitated intra-household cooperation as well as competition.
    </p>

    <h2>Legal & Modern Status</h2>
    <p>
      Today, many Muslim-majority countries legally allow polygyny, with nuances—for instance, requiring the husband's court approval for additional wives or giving the first wife the right to impose monogamy. Legal reforms continue to evolve as debates over gender equality intensify.
