    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In imperial China, polygamy was practiced as a hierarchical system. A man was allowed one principal wife (the diqi) and could have multiple concubines (qie), whose status was clearly demarcated. Similar practices were also observed in historic Korea and Japan.
    </p>

    <h2>Customs & Social Order</h2>
    <p>
      Among the upper classes, the presence of concubines was not only a symbol of wealth but a means to ensure the continuation of the family line in a society that prized male heirs. The main wife managed domestic affairs and even oversaw the daily interactions of concubines.
    </p>

    <h2>Legal and Cultural Shifts</h2>
    <p>
      Although the practice was widespread during the imperial era, modern legal reforms in East Asia led to the abolition of polygamy. Today, these historical arrangements are examined through literature, art, and academic research.
