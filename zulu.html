  <h2>Geographic Location &amp; Time Period</h2>
  <p>
    Centered in KwaZulu-Natal, the Zulu Kingdom flourished in the late 18th–19th centuries. Polygyny continued into modern times under customary law.
  </p>

  <h2>Cultural Traditions &amp; Beliefs</h2>
  <p>
    Lobola (bridewealth in cattle) formalizes marriages. Chiefs and successful farmers traditionally took multiple wives to cement political alliances and ensure numerous heirs.
  </p>

  <h2>Sociopolitical Structure</h2>
  <p>
    Zulu homesteads are organized under a patriarch and his wives. The first wife (<em>inhlunkulu</em>) holds ceremonial seniority; co-wives manage distinct tasks like fieldwork, beer brewing, and childcare.
  </p>
  <ul class="indented-list">
    <li><strong>Alliances:</strong> Each marriage connects clans, expanding influence.</li>
    <li><strong>Legacy:</strong> More wives ensured plenty of sons for lineage continuity.</li>
    <li><strong>Labor Division:</strong> Co-wives share agricultural and domestic duties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Anthropological Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    Ethnographic accounts reveal that while co-wives often support each other, jealousy over status and resource allocation was a recurring theme—captured in the proverb, “A single wife cannot feed her children alone.”
  </p>

  <h2>Legal &amp; Modern Status</h2>
  <p>
    The Recognition of Customary Marriages Act (1998) legalizes polygyny under strict conditions: all spouses must be registered and treated equally. Urban Zulus increasingly favor monogamy, but rural chiefs still maintain multiple-wife households.
  </p>

  <h2>Textual Evidence</h2>
  <blockquote class="book">
    “Umfazi ongashadanga akayena umfazi.”<br>
    — “A woman not married is not considered a woman.”
  </blockquote>
