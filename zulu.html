    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Zulu, an ethnic group in South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal, have a long history of polygyny intertwined with chieftaincy and alliance-building. Leaders and elites traditionally maintained multiple wives as a means to solidify political power and ensure robust offspring numbers.
    </p>

    <h2>Cultural Traditions & Beliefs</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional Zulu marriages involve lobola (bridewealth in cattle) and a ceremonial process called ukukhetha. Although co-wife relationships sometimes develop supportive bonds, rivalry over the husband’s attention and resources is also noted.
    </p>

    <h2>Sociopolitical Structure</h2>
    <p>
      Polygyny among the Zulu reinforced a strictly patriarchal hierarchy. Family units were organized around the male head whose ability to provide equally for his many wives was an indicator of status. Customary law continues to provide a framework for these unions today.
    </p>

    <h2>Anthropological Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      Detailed ethnographic studies have observed that Zulu polygyny functioned both as a traditional cultural practice and as a practical approach to ensure the continuity of the lineage. Oral histories and proverbs further attest to the dual nature of both cooperation and conflict among co-wives.
    </p>

    <h2>Legal & Modern Status</h2>
    <p>
      Modern South African law recognizes customary polygamous marriages under specific conditions. While civil law remains monogamous, the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act (1998) safeguards traditional practices—albeit with an ongoing public debate over gender equality.
