    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In the ancient Near East—from Mesopotamia to Canaan—the practice of polygyny was a mark of power among kings and tribal elites. Biblical texts recount that figures such as Abraham, David, and Solomon maintained multiple wives and concubines as part of their dynastic and diplomatic strategies.
    </p>

    <h2>Cultural and Religious Context</h2>
    <p>
      In these early societies, marriage was largely a tool for cementing alliances and ensuring the continuation of a lineage in an era when high infant mortality was common. Practices like levirate marriage further expanded family networks.
    </p>

    <h2>Sociopolitical Structure</h2>
    <p>
      The strictly patriarchal and patrilineal nature of these societies meant that only the wealthy or powerful could afford multiple marriages. Royal courts even used marriage as a diplomatic tool by taking wives from allied or subordinate groups.
    </p>

    <h2>Legal and Later Developments</h2>
    <p>
      Although polygamy was widespread in antiquity, later religious reforms gradually shifted norms. In early Judaism, for example, later rabbinic edicts moved toward monogamy, while in early Christianity, monogamy became the standard.
