        <h3>c. 2000 BCE – 500 BCE: Foundations in the Ancient Near East</h3>
        <p>
          In Mesopotamia, Canaan, and Biblical Israel, polygamy emerged as an institution among elites. Legal codes like the Code of Hammurabi permitted a man to take a second wife under certain conditions (e.g., if the first was barren). Biblical narratives recount that patriarchs such as Abraham, David, and Solomon practiced polygyny—Solomon is famously reported to have had 700 wives and 300 concubines.

        <h3>c. 1500–500 BCE: Early Biblical Norms and Dynastic Alliances</h3>
        <p>
          During the Hebrew Bible period, polygyny was a marker of wealth and lineage security. Stories of Abraham taking Hagar as a second wife and Jacob’s complex marital arrangements exemplify how multiple marriages helped forge tribal alliances and secure heirs.

        <h3>7th Century CE: The Advent of Islam and Regulated Polygyny</h3>
        <p>
          With the emergence of Islam, the Quran introduced a regulated form of polygyny—up to four wives if the husband can treat them equitably. This model spread rapidly throughout Arabia and across the Islamic Caliphates, affecting marriage norms in regions from North Africa to South Asia.

        <h3>7th – 15th Centuries CE: Islamic Empires and Controlled Harems</h3>
        <p>
          Under empires such as the Umayyads, Abbasids, and Ottomans, polygyny became part of elite household formation. Royal harems were strictly regulated, and concubinage provided a structured means of ensuring lineage continuation while balancing economic and social duties.

        <h3>Africa – Indigenous Polygyny and Rare Polyandry</h3>
        <p>
          In Africa, especially along the "polygamy belt" of West and Central Africa, polygyny has deep cultural roots. Among the Yoruba of Nigeria, multiple wives signified wealth and social status, and wives were often housed in separate quarters within extended family compounds. In contrast, the Maasai of Kenya and Tanzania employed polygyny as an adaptive strategy in pastoral economies, where additional wives helped manage cattle and secure larger herds.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Southern Africa, the Zulu integrated polygyny into chiefdom structures, using lobola (bridewealth in cattle) to cement alliances. Notably, the Irigwe of Nigeria represent a rare case of African polyandry—a custom that lasted into the mid-20th century before being outlawed.

        <h3>South Asia – Royal Polygyny, Colonial Reforms, and Informal Polyandry</h3>
        <p>
          On the Indian subcontinent, Hindu kings and Muslim rulers historically practiced polygyny. While princely states and Mughal courts maintained harems to cement alliances and secure heirs, common practice among Hindus was largely monogamous. In contrast, certain Himalayan communities developed fraternal polyandry to prevent the fragmentation of scarce arable land—a custom immortalized in epics like the Mahabharata.

        <h3>Fraternal Polyandry in the Himalayas</h3>
        <p>
          In the high-altitude regions encompassing Tibet, parts of Nepal, and northern India, fraternal polyandry emerged as a pragmatic adaptation. Brothers sharing one wife preserved family land by preventing inheritance division. This practice, deeply embedded in local traditions and reinforced by narratives (e.g., descent from the Pandavas and Draupadi), began to decline in the mid-20th century due to legal reforms.

        <h3>East Asia – Imperial China and the Abolition of Concubinage</h3>
        <p>
          In imperial China, polygyny was practiced as a hierarchical system where one official wife was accompanied by concubines. This arrangement, essential for dynastic continuity, was maintained until the early 20th century. With the Communist Revolution and subsequent marriage reforms, China—and similarly, Korea, Japan, and Taiwan—abolished polygamous practices in favor of strict monogamy.

        <h3>Southeast and Central Asia – Traditions Amid Modern Reforms</h3>
        <p>
          In Southeast Asia, traditional polygyny was influenced by indigenous customs as well as Islamic law. In Thailand, for example, the concept of “minor wives” persisted culturally even after legal abolition, while in Malaysia and Indonesia, Islamic polygyny remains regulated. Central Asian nomads historically practiced polygyny as a means of forging alliances, though Soviet and modern legal regimes have curtailed these practices.

        <h3>Oceania – Polynesian Polygyny and Aboriginal Traditions</h3>
        <p>
          Polynesian chiefdoms practiced high-status polygyny as a marker of mana (spiritual prestige) and to cement alliances, while Indigenous Aboriginal Australians engaged in polygyny to maximize subsistence in foraging societies. In both cases, the marital systems were intricately connected with kinship and communal living, though modern legal frameworks have since suppressed these practices.

        <h3>Indigenous Americas – Polygyny and Partible Paternity</h3>
        <p>
          Across Native American societies, polygyny was practiced—often as sororal polygyny—to strengthen family bonds and enhance economic cooperation. In some Amazonian tribes, a belief in partible paternity (the idea that a child can have more than one father) created a form of quasi-polyandry, where multiple men shared paternal responsibilities without formal plural marriage.

        <h3>19th-Century Mormon Polygyny on the American Frontier</h3>
        <p>
          In mid-19th century Utah, religiously sanctioned plural marriage was practiced by members of the LDS Church. Propounded as a restoration of Old Testament practices, Mormon polygamy enabled leaders like Brigham Young to maintain extensive families. Despite its initial growth, government intervention and legal rulings eventually led to the church’s formal cessation of the practice, though fundamentalist groups continue to maintain it covertly.

        <h3>Modern Global Transitions: From Plurality to Monogamy</h3>
        <p>
          Today, most modern legal systems enforce monogamy even if certain customary or religious provisions allow for plural marriage. Globalization, urbanization, and international human rights norms have gradually marginalized traditional polygamous practices, though cultural memories and informal practices persist in some regions. The diversity of historical marital systems—from resource-driven polyandry in the Himalayas to elite polygyny in ancient empires—offers a profound insight into how societies balance economic imperatives, kinship values, and gender dynamics.
