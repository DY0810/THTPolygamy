    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Yoruba, one of the major ethnic groups of southwestern Nigeria, have a long tradition of polygyny. Historically, having multiple wives was a status symbol—evidence by royal figures like the Ooni of Ife, whose ancestors were reputed to have taken dozens of wives as a mark of prestige.
    </p>

    <h2>Cultural Traditions & Beliefs</h2>
    <p>
      In traditional Yoruba culture, marriage was not only a personal union but also a social institution. Wives were often housed in separate quarters within a large family compound. Multiple wives contributed to farming, trade, and the overall productivity of the household. Over time, as Islam and Christianity entered the region, these practices evolved while still retaining deep cultural significance.
    </p>

    <h2>Sociopolitical Structure</h2>
    <p>
      Yoruba society is strictly patriarchal and patrilineal. Men with sufficient resources could marry several wives to expand their household labor and produce more offspring. Within polygynous households, senior wives typically had authority over junior wives—a hierarchy that both structured domestic life and helped maintain social order.
    </p>

    <h2>Anthropological Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      Anthropologists note that while polygyny reinforced male authority, it also provided economic advantages. Co-wife arrangements sometimes allowed women to share domestic and commercial duties, even as they navigated rivalries. Proverbial wisdom and folklore in Yoruba culture frequently reference the benefits and challenges of multiple marriages.
    </p>

    <h2>Legal & Modern Status</h2>
    <p>
      In contemporary Nigeria, Yoruba polygamous unions are legally recognized under customary or Islamic law in many regions, although civil law mandates monogamy. With rapid urbanization and modern legal reforms, traditional polygyny has seen a marked decline in urban centers while persisting in rural areas.
