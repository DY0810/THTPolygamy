  <h2>Geographic Location &amp; Time Period</h2>
  <p>
    The Yoruba inhabit southwestern Nigeria and parts of Benin and Togo. Polygyny has been integral to Yoruba sociopolitical life for centuries, documented in both pre-colonial oral traditions and colonial-era ethnographies.
  </p>

  <h2>Cultural Traditions &amp; Beliefs</h2>
  <p>
    In indigenous Yoruba religion, a man’s number of wives directly signified his wealth and spiritual favor. Royalty, like the Ooni of Ife, historically took dozens of wives—Olori Ronke Ademiluyi-Ogunwusi notes her grandfather had 47 wives—as both a status symbol and a means of forging kinship alliances.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each wife lived in her own wing of the family compound (<em>àgbo ilé</em>), managing her quarters, children, and contributions to farming, palm oil production, or trading ventures. Under Islam and Christianity, polygyny (up to four wives) continued among converts, blending religious injunctions with traditional customs.
  </p>

  <h2>Sociopolitical Structure</h2>
  <p>
    Yoruba society is patrilineal and patriarchal. A man pays bridewealth (<em>owó ìyá-ọ́mọ</em>) for each union, securing children’s inheritance rights. Senior wives (<em>ùyọ̀</em>) arbitrate disputes among co-wives and represent the household in village councils.
  </p>
  <ul class="indented-list">
    <li><strong>Workforce Expansion:</strong> Additional wives increase farm labor and market earnings.</li>
    <li><strong>Kinship Networks:</strong> Marriages link clans across regions—essential for trade alliances.</li>
    <li><strong>Lineage Continuity:</strong> More wives reduce the risk of a lineage dying out in high infant-mortality environments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Anthropological Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    Jack Goody and others observed that polygyny correlates with economies relying heavily on female labor. Yoruba proverb: 
    <blockquote class="book">
      “Obì kọ́ ló ń sún mọ́ obìnrin kan, obìnrin méjì ló ń ṣé pọ̀.”<br>
      — “A man isn’t bound to one woman; he thrives with many.”
    </blockquote>
    Co-wife solidarity often emerges in shared child-rearing and trading tasks, though competition over a husband’s favor and resources is a persistent theme in folklore.
  </p>

  <h2>Legal &amp; Modern Status</h2>
  <p>
    Today, customary law in many Yoruba states and Sharia in the north legally recognize polygyny. Civil courts in urban southern Nigeria default to monogamy, contributing to a marked decline of the practice in cities, even as it endures in rural communities.
