    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In the high altitudes of the Himalayas, where arable land is extremely scarce, fraternal polyandry emerged as a practical solution to prevent the fragmentation of family property. In these societies, brothers would jointly marry a single woman, ensuring that land and resources stayed consolidated.
    </p>

    <h2>Customs & Practices</h2>
    <p>
      This practice is best known among Tibetan and certain northern Indian communities. The system allowed the eldest brother to assume primary responsibility, while younger brothers participated as co-husbands. Although it provided economic benefits, it also necessitated strict cooperation among family members.
    </p>

    <h2>Legal and Social Transition</h2>
    <p>
      Modern legal systems in India and Nepal have outlawed polyandry; however, traces of this practice continue in remote areas. Today, these traditions are studied as an important anthropological adaptation to environmental constraints.
