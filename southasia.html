    <h2>Historical Context</h2>
    <p>
      In the Indian subcontinent, polygyny was traditionally practiced among royal families and upper castes. Hindu epics and legends recount tales of gods and heroes with multiple wives. However, by the mid-20th century, legal reforms—such as the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955—prohibited polygamy for most communities.

    <h2>Cultural Traditions & Reforms</h2>
    <p>
      While historical Hindu polygamy was confined mostly to elites, Muslim communities in South Asia have continued to practice regulated polygyny. The modern era has seen a significant shift, with economic and educational advancements driving a move toward monogamy for the majority of the population.
