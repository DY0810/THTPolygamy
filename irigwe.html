    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike the more common polygynous practices, the Irigwe of Nigeria practiced polyandry, allowing a woman to have multiple husbands concurrently. This practice served to pool labor for marginal farming and to forge inter-village kinship ties.
    </p>

    <h2>Cultural Traditions & Beliefs</h2>
    <p>
      In Irigwe custom, a woman might marry one man formally and later take on additional husbands as “secondary marriages.” These unions were accepted by the community, and children were socially attributed to the husband with whom the mother resided at the time of birth.
    </p>

    <h2>Sociopolitical Structure</h2>
    <p>
      The relatively egalitarian structure of Irigwe society allowed for high female autonomy in marriage. Rather than transferring exclusive reproductive rights, marriage in this context created extensive kinship networks that enhanced inter-village solidarity.
    </p>

    <h2>Anthropological Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      Anthropologists consider Irigwe polyandry an adaptive solution in a challenging agrarian environment. It pooled the resources and labor of several men under one union and prevented the fragmentation of land through partitioned inheritance.
    </p>

    <h2>Legal & Modern Status</h2>
    <p>
      While officially outlawed by the community council in 1968, the echoes of polyandrous practices can still be observed informally. Today, Nigerian law does not recognize polyandrous marriages, and the Irigwe have largely assimilated to surrounding monogamous practices.
