      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Yoruba (Nigeria) – Sub-Saharan Africa</td>
          <td>
            Polygyny (one man, multiple wives); historically prevalent with polygamy rates as high as 30–40% in some rural areas.
          </td>
          <td>
            Indicators of wealth, increased household labor (farming/trade), bridewealth, and social prestige. Cultural and religious acceptance (both indigenous and later Islamic influences) reinforce the practice.
          </td>
          <td>
            Legally recognized under customary or Islamic law in northern Nigeria; civil law generally upholds monogamy in southern regions. Overall, the practice is declining in urban areas.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Maasai (Kenya/Tanzania) – East Africa</td>
          <td>
            Polygyny; an ideal in pastoral communities with multiple wives per elder man.
          </td>
          <td>
            Pastoral economy (more wives enable greater cattle management), social organization (age-set systems), and cultural idealization of elder male status.
          </td>
          <td>
            Legally recognized under customary law in both Kenya and Tanzania. Modern trends indicate a gradual shift towards monogamy in urban areas.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Zulu (South Africa) – Southern Africa</td>
          <td>
            Polygyny traditionally practiced among chiefs and elites; historically integrated into chiefdom and political alliances.
          </td>
          <td>
            Use of lobola (bridewealth in cattle), alliance formation, and a cultural imperative for heirs. Social status and the reinforcement of patriarchal authority are central.
          </td>
          <td>
            Legally recognized under the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act; balanced by constitutional promotion of gender equality. Customary practice remains among traditionalists.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Irigwe (Nigeria) – Unique Case in Africa</td>
          <td>
            Polyandry (one woman, multiple husbands); a rare historical practice.
          </td>
          <td>
            Intended to forge inter-village bonds, pool husbands’ resources, and address issues such as infertility in marginal farming contexts.
          </td>
          <td>
            Officially outlawed by the tribe in 1968 and not recognized by modern Nigerian law; largely assimilated into monogamous norms.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Middle East (Arab & Islamic)</td>
          <td>
            Predominantly polygyny (with a maximum of four wives as prescribed by Islamic law); historically practiced by elites in harems.
          </td>
          <td>
            Religious sanction (Quran 4:3), care for widows/orphans, status symbols, and patrilineal demands for heirs.
          </td>
          <td>
            Legal in most Muslim-majority countries (with exceptions such as Turkey and Tunisia where it is banned); usage rates are relatively low (often <1% among general population).
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>South Asia (India, Nepal)</td>
          <td>
            Polygyny among Hindu royalty and certain Muslim communities; fraternal polyandry in Himalayan regions.
          </td>
          <td>
            For polygyny: royal alliances, maintenance of male lineage, and cultural/religious norms. For polyandry: scarcity of arable land to prevent inheritance division and preserve family estates.
          </td>
          <td>
            In India, polygamy is illegal for Hindus (since 1955) but remains legal for Muslims under personal law. Nepal and Bhutan have outlawed polygamy; polyandry is not legally recognized.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>East Asia (China, Korea, Japan)</td>
          <td>
            De facto polygyny through concubinage historically; one official wife with additional concubines common among elites.
          </td>
          <td>
            Driven by Confucian values emphasizing male heirs, social status, and agrarian wealth; a symbol of elite privilege.
          </td>
          <td>
            All East Asian states now enforce strict monogamy; plural marriage is criminalized (e.g., bigamy laws) despite occasional unofficial mistress arrangements.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Southeast Asia (Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia)</td>
          <td>
            Traditional polygyny across various classes; in Thailand (pre-1935 "mia noi" system) and Islamic polygyny in Malay/Indonesian communities.
          </td>
          <td>
            A blend of indigenous traditions and Islamic norms; driven by economic capacity and social prestige. In some cases, the concept of a “minor wife” persists culturally.
          </td>
          <td>
            Legal systems vary: Thailand abolished polygamy in 1935 while it remains legal in Muslim-majority contexts in Malaysia and Indonesia (albeit under regulated conditions). Practice is declining among younger generations.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Oceania (Polynesia, Aboriginal Australia)</td>
          <td>
            Polygyny was common among Polynesian chiefs and Indigenous Australian elders.
          </td>
          <td>
            In Polynesia, used for alliance-building and enhancing mana (spiritual prestige); in Aboriginal contexts, to increase resource management and ensure collective child care.
          </td>
          <td>
            Modern legal systems enforce monogamy; historical practices now survive only as cultural memory or informal arrangements.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Indigenous Americas</td>
          <td>
            Polygyny practiced by many Native American tribes, often as sororal polygyny; polyandry was virtually non-existent.
          </td>
          <td>
            Economic cooperation (e.g., processing resources), care for widows, and social alliance-building were key. In some Amazonian tribes, the belief in partible paternity allowed for a form of multi-fatherhood.
          </td>
          <td>
            Polygamy is outlawed in modern U.S. and Canadian law; traditional practices persist only as historical memory or in isolated instances.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Mormons (LDS, USA)</td>
          <td>
            Polygyny was once widely practiced (affecting approximately 20–30% of families in 19th-century Utah) as “plural marriage.”
          </td>
          <td>
            Driven by religious doctrines (a restoration of Old Testament practices), demographic needs on the frontier, and communal pressures for rapid population growth.
          </td>
          <td>
            Officially banned by the LDS Church in 1890 (with subsequent legal prohibitions in the U.S.); now only practiced secretly by fundamentalist groups.
          </td>
