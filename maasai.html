    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Maasai are semi-nomadic pastoralists of Kenya and Tanzania. Polygyny in Maasai culture is idealized as it allows elders to accumulate wives and produce the large families necessary to manage extensive cattle herds.
    </p>

    <h2>Cultural Traditions & Beliefs</h2>
    <p>
      Traditionally, Maasai marriages were arranged by elders. Bridewealth was paid in cattle, and each wife lived in her own hut within the homestead. As young men matured, they would join established age-sets; only elders were permitted to take multiple wives.
    </p>

    <h2>Sociopolitical Structure</h2>
    <p>
      Maasai society is rigorously patriarchal and gerontocratic. The authority within a family rests with the husband and his senior wives. Polygyny thus plays an essential role in social status and economic survival in a pastoral setting.
    </p>

    <h2>Anthropological Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      Research shows that while polygyny bolstered community labor—ensuring efficient cattle management and household upkeep—it also sometimes resulted in a “wife deficit” for younger men. Despite potential rivalry, the system functioned as an adaptive strategy to the region's economic conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>Legal & Modern Status</h2>
    <p>
      In Kenya and Tanzania, polygamous unions are recognized under customary law. Recent legal reforms (such as Kenya’s 2014 regulations) have both codified and limited these practices, reinforcing the cultural tradition in rural communities while modernizing urban family law.
