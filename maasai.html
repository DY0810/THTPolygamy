  <h2>Geographic Location &amp; Time Period</h2>
  <p>
    The Maasai roam the semi-arid plains of southern Kenya and northern Tanzania. Polygyny has been idealized for centuries among elder men as part of their age-set social system.
  </p>

  <h2>Cultural Traditions &amp; Beliefs</h2>
  <p>
    Marriage is arranged by elders, with bridewealth paid in cattle. Each wife resides in her own <em>enkang</em> (hut), where she rears children, milks cows, and tends the household. Cattle not only measure wealth but also determine how many wives a man may afford.
  </p>

  <h2>Sociopolitical Structure</h2>
  <p>
    Maasai society is patriarchal and gerontocratic: elders hold decision-making power. Polygyny extends a man’s labor force for herding and cultivates alliances between clans. Senior wives coordinate junior wives, ensuring order in the homestead.
  </p>
  <ul class="indented-list">
    <li><strong>Pastoral Productivity:</strong> More wives mean more labor for cattle management.</li>
    <li><strong>Age-Set Alliances:</strong> Marriages reinforce bonds across warrior and elder classes.</li>
    <li><strong>Widow Support:</strong> Polygyny provides security for women who lose husbands early due to age gaps.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Anthropological Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    Ethnographers note that while cooperation among co-wives is common during milking or child care, competition arises when inheritance becomes pressing. The proverb “A man without cattle has no bride” encapsulates the economic logic driving polygyny.
  </p>

  <h2>Legal &amp; Modern Status</h2>
  <p>
    Customary law in Kenya and Tanzania permits polygynous unions. However, urbanization, formal education, and alternative livelihoods are gradually reducing its incidence, especially among younger generations.
  </p>

    “A man with many cows may marry many wives; a poor man stays alone.”<br>
    — Maasai Proverb
